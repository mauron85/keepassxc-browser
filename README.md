# keepassxc-browser
Chrome extension for [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) with Native Messaging.

This is a heavily forked version of [pfn](https://github.com/pfn)'s [chromeIPass](https://github.com/pfn/passifox).
For testing purposes, please use following unofficial KeePassXC [release's](https://github.com/varjolintu/keepassxc/releases).

Get the extension for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/keepassxc-browser/) or [Chrome/Chromium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepassxc-browser/iopaggbpplllidnfmcghoonnokmjoicf).

## Protocol

Transmitting messages between KeePassXC and keepassxc-browser is totally rewritten. This is still under development.
Now the requests are encrypted by [TweetNaCl.js](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js) box method and does the following:

1. keepassxc-browser generates a key pair (with public and secret key) and transfers the public key to KeePassXC
2. When KeePassXC receives the public key it generates its own key pair and transfers the public key to keepassxc-browser
3. All messages (excluding get-databasehash) are now encrypted.
4. When keepassxc-browser sends a message it is encrypted with KeePassXC's public key, a random generated nonce and keepassxc-browser's secret key.
5. When KeePassXC sends a message it is encrypted with keepassxc-browser's public key etc.
6. Databases are stored based on the current public key used with `associate`. A new key pair for data transfer is generated each time keepassxc-browser is launched.

Encrypted messages are built with these JSON parameters:
- action - `test-associate`, `associate`, `get-logins`, `get-logins-count`, `set-login`...
- message - Encrypted message, base64 encoded
- nonce - 24 bytes long random data, base64 encoded. This must be the same when responding to a request.
